# Uses

This is a living document of the tools I use to create this website and record my demo loops.

## Guitar

My trusty K'mo Memphis Standard in open pore metallic blue. It's a T-style guitar completely handmade by [Moe, a luthier from Berlin](https://berlin-guitars.de/kmoguitars/).

Plays like butter, looks stunning and has that classic Telecaster sound. Very versatile.

These are the specs to the best of my knowledge:

- 12" fretboard radius
- Katalox fretboard
- Maple neck
- Korina body
- Wilkinson bridge (brass saddles)
- Handwound K'Mo pickups

**Picks**: Mostly orange Dunlop Tortex 0.60mm

**Strings**: Ernieball Power Slinkys (11s)

**Cables**: EBS Gold Flat Patch Cables and and standard Fender instrument cables

## Recording

All my demos are recorded at home with a silent setup. For more details, read my full [article on my recording process](/posts/recording-setup).

- Audio interface: Focusrite Scarlett 2i2
- DAW: GarageBand
- Laptop: 2016 Macbook Pro
- Monitoring: AKG K240 MkII headphones
- Amp/Cab Sim: [Strymon Iridium](/demos/strymon-iridium)
- Radial Engineering Pro RMP Reamp to reamp my dry signal to the pedal that I'm demoing.

## Coding

- I built this website with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- I code in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) as my terminal.
- Hosting is done via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Domain is registered at [gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/)
- For pretty much every app where I can customize the color scheme (code editor, terminal, notes, slack, this website ðŸ˜‰), I use the [Dracula color theme](https://draculatheme.com/).

<!-- ## Current Pedalboard

This will change the most over time but doesn't have to do much with the sound of the demos.

I don't keep all the pedals that I'm demoing. Very often, I'm just curious about a pedal and want to collect it's soul via this site. So I resell it after I recorded the demo loops and use the money to buy some other pedal. Doesn't mean I didn't like it.

I use this pedalboard for band projects and it most represents what _my_ personal sound at the moment is like:
