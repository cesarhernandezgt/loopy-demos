# Uses

This is a living document of the tools I use to create this website and record my demo loops.

## Guitar

My trusty K'mo Memphis Standard in open pore metallic blue. It's a T-style guitar completely handmade by Moe, a luthier from Berlin.

Plays like butter, looks stunning and has that classic Telecaster sound. Very versatile.

These are the specs to the best of my knowledge:

- 12" fretboard radius
- Katalox fretboard
- Maple neck
- Korina body
- Wilkinson bridge (brass saddles)
- Handwound K'Mo pickups

**Picks**: Orange Dunlop Tortex 0.60mm

**Strings**: Ernieball Power Slinkys (11s)

**Cables**: EBS Gold Flat Patch Cables and and standard Fender instrument cables

## Recording

All my demos are recorded at home with a silet setup.

I use a Scarlett Focusrite 2i2 audio interface. I record in GarageBand on a 2016 Macbook Pro.

For monitoring, I use AKG K240 MkII headphones.

The Strymon Iridium is my amp/cab sim and is the clean reference for all demos.

I use a Radial Engineering Pro RMP Reamp to reamp a dry D.I. signal to the pedal that I'm demoing.

## Coding

I built this website with Gatsby and React.

I code in VSCode and use Hyper as my terminal.

Hosting is done via Netlify.

## Current Pedalboard

This will change the most over time but doesn't have to do much with the sound of the demos.

I try to be minimalistic about my belongings. I don't keep all the pedals that I'm demoing. Very often, I'm just curious about a pedal and want to collect it's soul via this site. So I resell it after I recorded the demo loops and use the money to buy some other pedal. Doesn't mean I didn't like it.

I use this pedalboard for band projects and it most represents what _my_ personal sound is like:
