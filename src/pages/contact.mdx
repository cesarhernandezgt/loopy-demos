# Contact

A clutter-free inbox is important to me. Please check this list before you send me an email.

I will be more likely and quicker to respond the more boxes you're ticking off :)

**Are you a pedal builder and want me to demo your product on this site?** Great! Email me and we'll work out the details.

**You are a pedal/guitar dealer and want some of your items featured on this site?** I'm in.

**If you want to collaborate on something music or gear related**, hit me up! I might be interested.

**If you have a question about what gear/software I'm using**, check my [uses](/uses) page first. Tell me if I forgot something.

**Just wanna chat and bike shed about gear?** Follow and DM me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/loopydemos/).

**If you are a spammer**, please fuck off.

<!-- Please consider these items of email courtesy when writing to me:

- Use paragraphs, avoid large walls of text.
- Number your asks if there are multiple
- Keep it as short as you can -->

Okay, that's it. Shoot me that email to silvio@loopydemos.com
