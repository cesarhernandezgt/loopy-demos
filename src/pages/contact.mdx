A clutter-free inbox is important to me. Please check this list before you send me an email.

I will be more likely and quicker to respond the more boxes you're ticking off :)

Email me if there are details to be worked out.

**You are a pedal/guitar dealer and want some of your items featured on this site?** I'm in.

**If you want to collaborate on something music or gear related**, hit me up! I might be interested.

**If you have a question about what gear/software I'm using**, check my [uses](/uses) page first. Tell me if I forgot something.

**If you are Andy from Reverb**, definitely write to me regardless of the topic.

**Just wanna chat and bike shed about gear?** Follow and DM me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/loopydemos/).

**If you are a spammer**, please fuck off.
