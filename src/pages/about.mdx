# About

Hey ðŸ‘‹

My name is Silvio. I like guitar pedals. A lot.

I always wanted to start something like a YouTube channel to demo pedals. I wanted some way of putting out music and have a purpose for the pedals other than collecting them. (Also, I was hoping to get some free stuff from time to time ðŸ˜‰)

But YouTube is pretty crowded in the guitar world. There are a lot of talented people doing demos already. I just feel I couldn't add much on that platform.

As a software developer, I figured I could add something unique to this niche. Instead of giving you a video with my hands in the way, I'm giving you control to fiddle with the pedal.

There is no skipping through videos or looking for timestamps. You're getting the most direct and instant comparison of the pedal settings and clean tone.
