The Topanga Spring Reverb from Catalinbread makes we wanna play drippy surf rock all day.

My personal taste usually leans towards more dry and crunchy tones. The Topanga plays really nice with drives and lets you finetune the reverb tails.

**Dwell** controls the length of the reverb tail. **Tone** affects the EQ of the reverb (from dark to bright). **Mix** sets the ratio of wet and dry signal. **Volume** sets the overall output of the pedal (wet and dry).

I really enjoy it with subtle settings. Especially with amp/cab sim, just a little spring reverb from the Topanga makes the tone come alive without being too much "on the nose".

**Signal chain**:

- Gretsch Electromatic (Blacktop Filtertrons, bridge pickup)
- [Falcon](/demos/crazy-tube-circuits-falcon) for a bit of crunch
- Topanga
- [Strymon Iridium (Chime)](/demos/strymon-iridium)
- Focusrite Scarlett 2i2
- Garageband
