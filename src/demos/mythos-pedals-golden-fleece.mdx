I like minimalistic design and the Golden Fleece nails it. There's just one knob which is called "More". It's only for adjusting the output volume of the pedal, which might alter gain pedals after the Golden Fleece or your amp.

But on its own, this pedal seems to have just one sound ... and this one sound is glorious. While being marketed as a fuzz, the Fleece is not actually a fuzz in the traditional sense. It uses clipping diodes to create the overdriven sound. The input seems to be quite open for bass frequencies, which gives it its fuzzy appearance.

The result is a nice and raunchy fuzz/overdrive with lots of presence. I can imagine this working very well for humbuckers, which can get muddy with classic fuzz face style circuits. However, it definitely does not suck with the bridge pickup of my Tele as well.

As I understood Zack (guy behind Mythos) from various interviews, the Fleece is to be used in conjuction with the volume knob on your guitar. As you can hear in the demo, with the guitar volume pretty low, we get a nice lofi sparkle. At around 60-70%, it's just a sweet low gain overdrive.
