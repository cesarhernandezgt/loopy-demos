The Animalizzer bla bla bla ...

**Features**: You get the standard overdrive control layout (drive, tone, volume) with an added gain toggle that can be accessed via a JHS Red Remote. On the side is a tiny slide switch to turn the high-cut on and off.

I find the Morning Glory pretty "cutting". While I always see it marketed as "transparent", this is definitely not the case - at least according to my ears. It has a bit of a honky mid hump. Not as pronounced as a Klon or a Tube Screamer, but it's there. I also feel a very drastic bass cut compared to other dirt pedals.

This makes the Morning Glory suitable as a boost for lead guitar or very cutting rhythm parts. It definitely makes sure that your guitar is heard in the mix.
