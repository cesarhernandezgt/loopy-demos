The Slö Multi Texture Reverb is a real dream machine. Anything you play into it just turns out magical and dreamy. It's really inspiring to play – almost as if an orchestra deep down in the ocean is playing along with you.

My favorite setting for "X" is the **dark** mode. It modulates the reverb so it's one octave below the original signal. This pedal is worth having even if it had just this one mode. This low octave reverb is pretty theatrical with just a subtle sine wave modulation.

**Rise** is nice if you want your dry signal to come through in the mix. The reverb swells in after you play something. The X knob controls how long it takes to rise. This gives your clean signal room to be heard and it can also be a quite intentional musical effect with longer rise times.

**Dream** sounds like a choir of mermaids singing along. It just sits really well behind your playing even with the mix pretty high up.

The different waveforms change the way the reverb is modulated. **Sine** modulates the signal symmetrically up and down. I like this with a more subtle depth to just add some movement.

**Warp** is asymmetrical and pitches the signal up, just like a warped vinyl LP.

**Sink** is also asymmetrical and pitches the signal down, like a Bigsby trem would.

For more extreme settings, I like the asymmetrical waveforms for some spooky/dreamy/mystical vibes.

The **filter** knob is very effective and alters the reverb from super smooth and dark to bright and screechy.

The **sustain** foot switch is a momentary foot switch for **dark** and **swell**. It ramps up the reverb trail to maximum and ramps back down to the decay setting when released. For **dream**, the sustain switch is latching and freezes the current reverb sound with endless sustain to create ambient pads. You can hear it in action in the _Swell Reverb with Sustain_ and _Latching Dream_ presets.
