The Slö is a real dream machine. Anything you play into just turns out magical and dreamy. It's really inspiring to play – almost as if an orchestra deep down in the ocean is playing along with you.

My favorite setting for "X" is the dark mode. It modulates the reverb so it's one octave below the original signal. This pedal is worth having even if it had just this one mode.

Dream and Rise are also super inspiring and usable.
