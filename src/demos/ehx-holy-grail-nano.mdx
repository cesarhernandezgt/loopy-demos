The Holy Grail by Electro Harmonix is a classic reverb pedal. It's affordable. It's simple. And it sounds really good!

There's one mix knob and 3 different types of reverb (2 of them usable). **Hall** is perfect for when you just need _some_ reverb to get your chords wet. **Spring** seems to emulate a spring reverb by using some kind of diffused slap back delay. And then there's **Flerb**, a useless mixture of reverb and flanger. Nobody likes it, and EHX keeps putting it in this pedal. And I think that's beautiful.

If you're not after a very specific reverb sound and just want some ambience in your sound, the Holy Grail is a very good utility option.
