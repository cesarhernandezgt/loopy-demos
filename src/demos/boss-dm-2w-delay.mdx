The DM-2w is BOSS' attempt at faithfully recreating their flag-ship analog delay. The DM-2 was first introduced in 1981 and is since then a highly sought-after vintage pedal.

With the Waza Craft version, you get that vintage sound and as a cherry on top they added a custom mode with longer and "cleaner" repeats.

A few features I can't demonstrate here: Expression pedal input to control the rate and separate output for the direct signal for your wet/dry rig.

The DM-2w is my go-to delay and is a staple on my pedalboard. It doesn't stand in the way of an overdriven sound, has a unique, warm character and is super simple to use.
