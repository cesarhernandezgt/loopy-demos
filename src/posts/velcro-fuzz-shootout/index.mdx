If there is a specific tone that I crave for my personal setup, then it’s **velcro fuzz**.

What is velcro fuzz? It’s hard to describe and one of those things where _you know it when you see it_. You could throw adjectives at it like gated, spitty and splattery, but still somewhat controlled.

It's great for live situations. It cuts through a mix pretty well. There is a feeling of your amp going bad in a good way. Due to the gated circuit, noise is pretty low when you don’t play anything. Fantastic for rhythm parts.

So how did the pedals perform?

**JHS Mini Foot Fuzz V2**

On full blast, this thing sounds like it’s whipping your ears. There is a hint of an octave up effect. "Splattery" definitely fits the bill here.

On the "tamed" setting, the Mini Foot actually sounded very tamed. I believe this would sound best with a low to medium gain drive before it.

There are no EQ controls on the Mini Foot. You have one sound to work with. And I think that’s beautiful.

**Smallsound/Bigsound Mini**

Wait what? Isn’t this an overdrive? Well, yeah but turn the gain up and the bias down a bit and welcome to fuzzland.

This sounded the most "dry" of all of the contenders. Listen to the silence in between notes during the staccato part of the loop.

The Mini shines again with its versatility. I do prefer this on the tamed setting.

**Animalizzer from T.X Pedals**

When I first got the Animalizzer, I didn’t even know it has this sound. And I think it‘s now my favorite sound of this pedal.

The key elements to achieving this sound is to select **open** for both clipping stages, turning **fuzz** and **pre-gain** past 70% and diming the **depth** knob.

To me, this had the best allround sound. It sounded fat, yet distinct with a nice natural fuzz sound. There’s also a lot of control with the 3-band EQ to adjust the tone to taste.

At full blast it was a bit noisier than the other two. If there was an actual bias knob here, I bet this could be remedied and would make it sound even more velcroy.
