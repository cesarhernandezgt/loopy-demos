## Amp/Cab Sim

I live in an apartment with my wife and 1-year old son. I could not imagine playing with an amp at home, not even a small one.

I use the Strymon Iridium as my amp/cab sim and it's the basis for all my guitar home recording. I tried many modelers. The Iridium is the first one that I just unboxed, plugged in and it sounded great without much fiddling.
I like that I can just turn some knobs and have a great sound instantly. There are more options available (saving favorites, loading third party IRs, adjusting room size, etc.).

The pedals I'm demoing are usually first in chain. I might make an exception for delay and reverb and place them after the Iridium. However, the Iridium is usually set very clean so it does not make a difference.

## Signal Chain

From the Iridium, the signal goes straight into the Scarlett Focusrite 2i2. I record everything in GarageBand. I might upgrade in the future to Logic. For the pedal demos it's not necessary since there is no post processing involved.

Here comes the tricky part: Each sound in the demos is an audio file where I recorded the whole loop with the settings you see during the demo. To have that seemless transition bewteen sounds, the loops need to be exactly the same (same timing and length). I achieve this by recording a dry direct signal. I loop that in GarageBand, connect one monitor output of the Focusrite to a reamp box. The reamp box runs into the pedal and the Strymon and back into the Focusrite again.

The dry signal is recorded like this: I play and record with the pedal engaged. But first in my chain is an Ernie Ball VP Junior volume pedal. I use the tuner out of the VP Junior and connect that to the second input of the Focusrite. This gives me an unaffected dry signal. No pedal, no amp/cab sim, just the dry guitar.

I record the dry signal and a "wet" signal (pedal + Iridium) at the same time. I just use the wet signal to get the feel right when recording and have an inspiring sound for monitoring. Later, I delete that signal and only use the dry signal to record the actual sound samples.

## Reamping with GarageBand

The "hack" to make reamping in GarageBand possible with a cheap Focusrite: Turn up the monitor volume on the Focusrite, add a master track in GarageBand and hard pan it to the side of the output you're using for reamping. You won't be able to monitor with the headphones from the Focusrite since this creates feedback. Instead, I just use the headphone out of the Iridium. I don't need a click at this point obviously.

Everything except the dry signal needs to be muted. Also the monitoring of the track you're recording needs to be turned of, as that will also create feedback.
