Here is a _behind-the-scenes_ look at my recording setup. I'll tell you all the little secrets about how I produce my pedal demos.

### Amp/Cab Sim

I live in an apartment with my wife and 1-year old son. I could not imagine playing with an amp at home, not even a small one.

I use the [Strymon Iridium](/demos/strymon-iridium) as my amp/cab sim and it's the basis for all my guitar home recordings.

The pedals I'm demoing are usually first in chain â€“ with the occasional exception for reverb and delay after the Iridium.

From the Iridium, the signal goes straight into the [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2\*](https://www.thomann.de/intl/focusrite_scarlett_2i2_3rd_gen.htm?partner_id=15606). I record everything in GarageBand.

### Creating the Sound Samples

Here comes the tricky part: Each sound in the demos is a separate audio file. I record the whole loop with the settings you see during the demo.

To have that seemless transition between sounds, the loops need to have the exact same timing and length.

I achieve this by reamping a dry recorded guitar signal into the pedal + Iridium and back into the interface again.

### Recording the Dry Signal

I use the XLR output and the tuner out of my [Radial Engineering SB-2 StageBug\*](https://www.thomann.de/intl/radial_engineering_sb_2.htm?partner_id=15606) to split the signal.

The XLR out goes directly to the audio interface. This is the dry and unaffected signal.

The other goes to the demoed pedal, Iridium and second input of the audio interface. I record dry and "wet" signal simultaneously.

The wet signal is just so that I have an inspiring monitor sound to record with and to "play to the pedal". Later, I delete the wet signal and only use the dry signal for reamping.

### Reamping with GarageBand

The "hack" to make reamping in GarageBand possible with a cheap Focusrite: Turn up the monitor volume on the Focusrite, add a master track in GarageBand and hard pan it to the side of the output you're using for reamping.

I connect the output to the [Radial Engineering Pro RMP Reamp\*](https://www.thomann.de/intl/radial_pro_rmp.htm?partner_id=15606). The reamp box is important to get signal level to the same level as the original guitar while keeping the noise level down.

You won't be able to monitor with the headphones from the Focusrite since this creates feedback. Instead, I just use the headphone out of the Iridium.

Everything except the track with the dry signal needs to be muted. Also the monitoring of the track you're recording needs to be turned of, as that will also create feedback.

### Choosing Settings

I usually have a general idea what features of the pedal I want to demonstrate. I try to play chords, riffs and melodies that I think suit the pedal well and make it easy to hear what the pedal does.

When I have a piece of music I think works well, I just loop it in GarageBand, reamp it and play with the pedal until I get an good or interesting sound. Then I hit record, sit back and repeat.

For the **sweeps** (usually just one knob in multiple positions), I try to record the positions where I hear the most differences.
