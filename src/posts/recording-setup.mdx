Here is a _behind-the-scenes_ look at my recording setup. I'll tell you all the little secrets about how I produce my pedal demos.

## Amp/Cab Sim

I live in an apartment with my wife and 1-year old son. I could not imagine playing with an amp at home, not even a small one.

I use the Strymon Iridium as my amp/cab sim and it's the basis for all my guitar home recordings. The Iridium is the first modeler that I just unboxed, plugged in and it sounded great without much fiddling.

## Signal Chain

The pedals I'm demoing are usually first in chain â€“ with the occasional exception for reverb and delay after the Iridium.

From the Iridium, the signal goes straight into the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2. I record everything in GarageBand.

## Creating the Sound Samples

Here comes the tricky part: Each sound in the demos is a separate audio file. I recorded the whole loop with the settings you see during the demo.

To have that seemless transition between sounds, the loops need to have the exact same timing length.

I achieve this by reamping a dry recorded guitar signal into the pedal + Iridium and back into the interface again.

## Recording the Dry Signal

I use the output and the tuner out of my Ernie Ball VP Jr 250k volume pedal to split the signal.

One goes directly to the audio interface. This is the dry and unaffected signal.

The other goes to the demoed pedal, Iridium and second input of the audio interface. I record dry and "wet" signal simultaneously.

The wet signal is just so that I have an inspiring monitor sound to record with and to "play to the pedal". Later, I delete the wet signal and only use the dry signal for reamping.

## Reamping with GarageBand

The "hack" to make reamping in GarageBand possible with a cheap Focusrite: Turn up the monitor volume on the Focusrite, add a master track in GarageBand and hard pan it to the side of the output you're using for reamping.

You won't be able to monitor with the headphones from the Focusrite since this creates feedback. Instead, I just use the headphone out of the Iridium. I don't need a click at this point obviously.

Everything except the dry signal needs to be muted. Also the monitoring of the track you're recording needs to be turned of, as that will also create feedback.

## Choosing Settings

I usually have a general idea what features of the pedal I want to demonstrate. I try to play chords, riffs and melodies that I think suit the pedal well and make it easy to hear what the pedal does.

For example, full-on strumming might not make sense for delays, because the repeats and the main signal are hard to differentiate. Also, light fingerpicking might not showcase a fuzz ver well.

When I have a piece of music I think works well, I just loop it in GarageBand, reamp it and play with the pedal until I get an good or interesting sound. Then I hit record, sit back and repeat.

For the **sweeps** (usually just one knob in multiple postions), I try to record the positions where I hear the most differences.
